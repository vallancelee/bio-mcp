# Bio-MCP Implementation Plan (End-to-End Incremental)

This document outlines an **end-to-end incremental approach** where we build a working biomedical research system layer by layer, with each layer being **basic → working → hardened**.

## Implementation Philosophy

Instead of going deep in one component, we build **horizontal slices** that deliver working functionality:

- **Foundation Layer**: Basic everything working end-to-end
- **Working Layer**: Production-capable system with robust features  
- **Hardened Layer**: Enterprise-ready deployment with security and scaling

Each phase delivers a **complete working system** that can be used and deployed.

## 🏗️ FOUNDATION LAYER (Basic Everything Working)

### Phase 1A: Basic MCP Server ✅ COMPLETED
**Goal**: Working MCP server with monitoring

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED**
- [x] Basic MCP server with ping tool
- [x] Container deployment ready
- [x] Health checks and monitoring
- [x] Comprehensive testing (58 tests, 100% passing)
- [x] Production-quality logging and error handling

### Phase 2A: Basic Database 🚧 NEXT
**Goal**: Store and retrieve biomedical data locally

**Deliverables**:
- [ ] SQLite database with basic schema
- [ ] SQLAlchemy models for PubMed documents
- [ ] Basic CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete)
- [ ] Database initialization and health checks
- [ ] Integration with existing MCP server

**Schema Design**:
```python
class PubMedDocument(Base):
    pmid = Column(String, primary_key=True)
    title = Column(String, nullable=False)
    abstract = Column(Text)
    authors = Column(JSON)  # List of author names
    publication_date = Column(Date)
    journal = Column(String)
    doi = Column(String)
    keywords = Column(JSON)  # List of keywords
    created_at = Column(DateTime, default=datetime.utcnow)
    updated_at = Column(DateTime, default=datetime.utcnow, onupdate=datetime.utcnow)
```

**Testing Requirements**:
- [ ] Unit tests for database models and operations
- [ ] Integration tests for database connectivity
- [ ] Health check validation for database
- [ ] Migration and initialization tests

### Phase 3A: Basic Biomedical Tools
**Goal**: Working PubMed search and retrieval tools

**Deliverables**:
- [ ] MCP tool: `pubmed.search` - Basic search with keywords
- [ ] MCP tool: `pubmed.get` - Retrieve document by PMID
- [ ] MCP tool: `pubmed.sync` - Store documents in database
- [ ] Simple HTTP client for NCBI E-utilities API
- [ ] Basic rate limiting and error handling

**Tool Implementations**:
```python
# pubmed.search
@server.call_tool()
async def pubmed_search(term: str, limit: int = 10) -> List[str]:
    """Search PubMed and return PMIDs"""

# pubmed.get  
@server.call_tool()
async def pubmed_get(pmid: str) -> PubMedDocument:
    """Get full document details by PMID"""

# pubmed.sync
@server.call_tool()
async def pubmed_sync(pmids: List[str]) -> SyncResult:
    """Fetch and store documents in database"""
```

**Foundation Layer Success Criteria**:
- ✅ Working MCP server that can search PubMed
- ✅ Store and retrieve biomedical literature locally  
- ✅ Complete end-to-end workflow: search → fetch → store → retrieve
- ✅ Can run locally with `make dev-setup && make run`

## 🧪 TESTING STRATEGY

### End-to-End Testing Approach
Each phase includes **complete workflow testing**:

**Foundation Layer**:
- ✅ Can start server → search PubMed → store results → query database
- ✅ All basic operations work locally

**Working Layer**:  
- ✅ Can deploy to staging → handle real workloads → recover from failures
- ✅ Performance meets production requirements

**Hardened Layer**:
- ✅ Can deploy to production → handle enterprise scale → meet security requirements
- ✅ Full operational monitoring and alerting

### Test Categories per Phase
- **Unit Tests**: Individual functions and classes
- **Integration Tests**: Service interactions and databases
- **End-to-End Tests**: Complete workflow validation
- **Performance Tests**: Load and stress testing
- **Security Tests**: Vulnerability and penetration testing

## 🚀 DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW

### Quick Start (Foundation Layer Complete)
```bash
# After Foundation Layer
git clone bio-mcp
make dev-setup
make run

# Working biomedical research server:
bio-mcp search --term "CRISPR gene editing"
bio-mcp get --pmid "12345678"  
bio-mcp sync --query "COVID-19 vaccines" --limit 100
```

### Production Deployment (Hardened Layer)
```bash
# Kubernetes deployment
kubectl apply -f k8s/
kubectl get pods bio-mcp

# Production monitoring
curl bio-mcp.company.com/health
curl bio-mcp.company.com/metrics
```
