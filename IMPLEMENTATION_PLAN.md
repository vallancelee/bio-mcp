# Bio-MCP Implementation Plan (End-to-End Incremental)

This document outlines an **end-to-end incremental approach** where we build a working biomedical research system layer by layer, with each layer being **basic → working → hardened**.

## Implementation Philosophy

Instead of going deep in one component, we build **horizontal slices** that deliver working functionality:

- **Foundation Layer**: Basic everything working end-to-end
- **Working Layer**: Production-capable system with robust features  
- **Hardened Layer**: Enterprise-ready deployment with security and scaling

Each phase delivers a **complete working system** that can be used and deployed.

    query: str,
    search_mode: str = "hybrid",     # "vector", "bm25", "hybrid"
    filters: dict = None,            # metadata filters
    rerank_by_quality: bool = True,  # boost by quality scores
    top_k: int = 10

```python
async def pubmed_sync_delta_tool(
    query_key: str,           # Named corpus identifier
    edat_start: str = None,   # Override start date (ISO8601)
    max_docs: int = 1000,     # Safety limit per sync
    overlap_days: int = 1     # Overlap to catch updates
) -> IncrementalSyncResult
```

#### **4B.3: Corpus Management** (Week 3)
- [ ] **corpus.checkpoint.get**: Read EDAT watermarks by query_key
- [ ] **corpus.checkpoint.set**: Manual watermark setting for backfills

```python
async def corpus_checkpoint_get_tool(query_key: str) -> CheckpointResult
async def corpus_checkpoint_set_tool(query_key: str, edat: str) -> CheckpointResult
```

#### **4B.4: MCP Resources & Polish** (Week 4)

- [ ] **Schema definitions**: JSON schemas for all tool inputs/outputs
- [ ] **Tool metadata**: Categories, safety flags, idempotent marking
- [ ] **Production readiness**: Error handling, logging, monitoring

**Target MCP Manifest Compliance**:

  - Removed broken tests: `test_end_to_end_rag_workflow.py`, `test_real_weaviate_integration.py`, `test_local_embeddings_integration.py`, `test_hybrid_search.py`
  - **Action needed**: Implement proper testcontainers for Weaviate integration tests
  - **Action needed**: Create better mocking strategy for service layer tests
