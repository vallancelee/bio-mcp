# Bio-MCP Implementation Plan (Incremental Maturity)

This document outlines an incremental approach where each component evolves through maturity phases: Basic → Robust → Production-Ready.

## Implementation Philosophy

Instead of building production-hardened features from day one, we'll implement in three maturity phases:

- **Phase A (Basic)**: Core functionality, local development, basic Docker
- **Phase B (Robust)**: Error handling, monitoring, staging deployment  
- **Phase C (Production)**: Security, scaling, full operational capabilities

Each component progresses through all phases before moving to the next component.

### Week 3-4: Robustness (All Component Phase B)  
- Error handling and retries
- Real API integrations
- PostgreSQL and proper database
- Monitoring and logging
- Full tool implementations

**Success Criteria**: Can deploy to staging environment and handle real workloads

### Week 5-6: Production (All Component Phase C)

- Kubernetes deployment
- Comprehensive monitoring
- Performance optimization

**Success Criteria**: Production-ready deployment with full operational capabilities

## Development Guidelines

### Incremental Testing
- Each phase must be fully tested before proceeding
- Integration tests increase in complexity with each phase
- Performance benchmarks established in Phase B, optimized in Phase C

### Documentation Evolution
- Phase A: Basic setup instructions
- Phase B: Operational runbooks
- Phase C: Complete production documentation

### Deployment Evolution
- Phase A: Local Docker Compose
- Phase B: Single-node Kubernetes or staging environment
- Phase C: Production Kubernetes with full operational features

This approach ensures we have working software early while systematically building toward production readiness.
