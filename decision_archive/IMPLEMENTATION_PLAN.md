# Bio-MCP Implementation Plan (End-to-End Incremental)

This document outlines an **end-to-end incremental approach** where we build a working biomedical research system layer by layer, with each layer being **basic → working → hardened**.

## Implementation Philosophy

Instead of going deep in one component, we build **horizontal slices** that deliver working functionality:

- **Foundation Layer**: Basic everything working end-to-end
- **Working Layer**: Production-capable system with robust features  
- **Hardened Layer**: Enterprise-ready deployment with security and scaling

Each phase delivers a **complete working system** that can be used and deployed.
