# Bio-MCP Future Development Roadmap

This document outlines the future development roadmap for Bio-MCP, focusing on enterprise-ready features and advanced capabilities beyond the current working system.

## Implementation Philosophy

Our development follows an **end-to-end incremental approach** with three distinct layers:

- **Foundation Layer**: Basic everything working end-to-end ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
- **Working Layer**: Production-capable system with robust features ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**  
- **Hardened Layer**: Enterprise-ready deployment with security and scaling üöß **IN PROGRESS**

Each layer delivers a **complete working system** that can be deployed and used in production.

## üéØ Success Metrics

### Hardened Layer Goals
- **Security**: Pass enterprise security audits and penetration testing
- **Scale**: Multi-region deployment supporting 1M+ documents
- **Performance**: <100ms search response time at 95th percentile
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime with proper monitoring and alerting
- **Compliance**: HIPAA/SOC2 compliance for healthcare data handling

### Advanced Features Goals
- **AI Integration**: Natural language research assistance with 90%+ user satisfaction
- **Multi-modal**: Support for images, tables, and structured data extraction
- **Workflow**: End-to-end systematic review support reducing research time by 50%
- **Real-time**: Sub-hour latency for new PubMed document availability

### Operational Excellence

## üöÄ Development Approach

### Implementation Strategy
1. **Security First**: All hardened layer features must include security review
2. **Observability Built-in**: Every feature includes metrics, logging, and tracing
3. **Performance Validation**: Load testing required before production deployment
4. **Documentation Driven**: Comprehensive docs and runbooks for operational features

### Technology Considerations
- **Kubernetes**: Container orchestration for scalability and reliability
- **Istio/Linkerd**: Service mesh for advanced traffic management and security
- **Prometheus/Grafana**: Monitoring and visualization stack
- **ELK/Loki**: Centralized logging and analysis
- **HashiCorp Vault**: Secrets management for production environments

### Deployment Patterns
- **Blue-Green Deployments**: Zero-downtime updates with quick rollback
- **Canary Releases**: Gradual rollout of new features with monitoring
- **Feature Flags**: Runtime configuration for A/B testing and gradual rollouts
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform/Pulumi for reproducible deployments
