2. **Streaming result integration** - Progressive display of PubMed, ClinicalTrials, and RAG results
3. **Advanced debugging capabilities** - Step-through execution with state inspection
4. **Performance monitoring** - Track timing, caching, and resource utilization
5. **User-friendly testing interface** - Intuitive query building and result exploration

### Success Criteria
- ✅ Execute end-to-end orchestrator queries with full visibility
- ✅ Real-time streaming updates with < 50ms UI latency
- ✅ Complete graph state inspection at each execution step
- ✅ Debug mode with breakpoints and manual node execution
- ✅ Export functionality for all results and performance data
- ✅ Session replay and comparison capabilities
